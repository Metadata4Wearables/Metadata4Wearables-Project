# Chronobiology Data Standards Interest Group (CDSIG)

    - Draft a brief **vision statement** using your personal and project goals. You might address:

      - The problem you’re trying to solve.

      - How you think openness and open leadership will help solve it.

      - How meeting your personal goals will help you and help solve the problem.

      - How meeting your cultural goals for your community, organization, or project will help solve the problem.

     - Add your vision statement to your repo by uploading it or copy and pasting it into your README document.

      - Anything else
      
Focus on actigraphy data
EEG standards set by sleep community

Two groups

(1) Adjacent data standards: BIDS, Frictionless Data
(2) Items for meta-data and data
    - Description of data vs. analysis separate
    - Modular
    - Optional vs. mandatory
    
(A) Collect samples, minimal set of descriptors
    
(B) Conceptual / sleep-wake timing
    Influence of the manufacturer and algorithm

Algorithm to distinguish wake from sleep
Larger goal: Understand algorithms and what they can do, tunable parameters; multiverse analysis; decouple uncertainties (systematic and statistical uncertainty).
Parameters - underlying; access to data and sharing from Liege; MESA data set has scoring

Community engagement

One group will be focused on data descriptors, including mandatory and optional measures, and coming up with a 'minimum data set' and how it is described.
- Grégory, Vincent, Manuel
  Google Draft
  
Another group will be focused on more conceptual issues, such as the types of analysis one can do with actigraphy data. What are the minimum concepts to get out of the data?
- Christina, Tara, Manuel

Meeting in weekend

Cross-manufacturer validation dataset
Traceable analytic pipeline

Goal: Two weeks
