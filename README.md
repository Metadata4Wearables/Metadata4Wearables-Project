# Chronobiology Data Standards Interest Group (CDSIG)

## Vision statement

The overarching goal of the **Chronobiology Data Standards Interest Group (CDSIG)** is to develop a set of meta-data and data standards for the field of chronobiology, with a view to enhancing the openness, transparency and reproducibility of research in the field.

As part of OLS-3, we will develop a data standard for actigraphy/actimetry, i.e. the quantitative measurement of rest and activity using movement counts from wrist- or ankle-worn devices. At present, there is no standard for formatting and storing data to render it shareable and useable in the long run. Furthermore, different manufacturers producing different data formats, which are only readable with the matching proprietary software.

More concretely, we will (1) produce a draft data standard, which identifies minimum, mandatory, and optional information to be contained in the data, (2) map out the extent to which different kinds of data can be used to analyse different physiological outcomes, such as minute-by-minute sleep-wake classifications, and (3) plan strategies for engaging with the community of manufacturers, researchers and research users.
