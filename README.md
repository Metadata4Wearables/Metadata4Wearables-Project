# Chronobiology Data Standards Interest Group (CDSIG)

## Vision statement

The goal of the **Chronobiology Data Standards Interest Group (CDSIG)** is to improve the openness, transparency and reproducibility of research in chronobiology.

We start with developing a set of meta-data and data standards for movement sensor data and related meta-data. Movement sensors are typically refered to as actigraphy, actimetry, or accelerometer, and can be worn at a variety of body locations. At present, there is no standard for formatting and storing data to render it shareable and useable in the long run. Furthermore, different manufacturers producing different data formats, which are only readable with the matching proprietary software.

More concretely as part of OLS-3, we will (1) produce a draft data standard, which identifies minimum, mandatory, and optional information to be contained in the data, (2) map out the extent to which different kinds of data can be used to extract and analyse different physiological outcomes, such as sleep-wake classification or chronotype, and (3) plan strategies for engaging with the community of sensor manufacturers, developers of (open-source) data processing software, researchers and research users.

In the long run, we also wish to develop guidelines and protocols for running and reporting actigraphy-based studies.
